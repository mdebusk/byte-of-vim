## Creating this book
This book would have never been written without Vim 7. My life would never have been complete without Vim. Thank you Bram Moolenaar and Vimmers all over the world.

The original content was written in Viki syntax were then strung together using [deplate](http://deplate.sourceforge.net).  Special thanks to [Thomas Link](http://www.vim.org/account/profile.php?user_id=4037) for patiently answering all my queries on how to use Viki/Deplate :-)

The book was later converted into a wiki format. Even though the book is now being edited online live, I still use Vim to write and copy/paste to [MediaWiki](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki) to save the text.

## Inspiration
I started writing this book in 2004 or so. It ended up on the back burner.

I revived writing the book in the month after [foss.in 2006](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FOSS.IN) thanks to the infective spirit of the people there.

But yet again, I couldn't sustain the momentum. I started to be more productive when I started following David Allen's [Getting Things Done](http://gettingthingsdone.com/) principles.  This led me to revive working on the book. I finally got it in good-enough shape to be released to the world on the first day of [foss.in 2008](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FOSS.IN).
