# What Next
## Introduction
We have explored so much about Vim. What's next?

If you have learned and understood vim and made it *a habit*, then you are officially a Vimmer. Congratulations!

Now, immediately [send me an e-mail](http://www.swaroopch.com/contact/) thanking me for this book ;-) . This step is optional but recommended. 

Also, you might [make a donation](http://www.swaroopch.com/byteofdonate) to support the continued development of this book, or donate to the Vim project to help children in Uganda.

Next, I recommend regularly following the [Vim mailing list](http://www.vim.org/maillist.php#vim) to see the kinds of queries and answers that appear there. You would be surprised to see the amount of activity and the range of flexibility of Vim demonstrated in the discussion. And you never know; you might be able to answer a few queries, too.

Two other important resources you should explore are the ["Best of Vim Tips"](http://zzapper.co.uk/vimtips.html) page and the all-important [user manual](http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/usr_toc.html), which is an index to everything possible in Vim. Make sure to refer the user manual from time to time and familiarize yourself with how to find the relevant information so you can look up commands as required.

Lastly, if you want to know the latest cool features in Vim, then see `:help new-7`.

## Summary
We have gone through a very broad overview of the range of things possible in Vim. The most important things we have stressed again and again are: to *not* learn every feature possible, but to make the features *most useful to you* a habit; and to make sure to use the `:help` to look for features when needed.

So, go forth and skyrocket your editing skills to greater efficiency and effectiveness than you ever thought possible.

Happy Vimming!
