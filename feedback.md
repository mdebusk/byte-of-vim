This book is also available on its official website as a wiki so go ahead and [fix things yourself](http://www.swaroopch.com/notes/Vim) as well!

Known Gaps are:

* Inconsistent use of examples
* Current strength is the later chapters (for experienced Vimmers) as opposed to the beginners' chapters.
