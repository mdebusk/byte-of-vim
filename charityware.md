# Charityware
Vim is "charityware". If you find Vim useful, you are encouraged to help the [ICCF Holland foundation](http://iccf-holland.org) in any way you can.

From their website:
    
    The south of Uganda has been suffering from the highest HIV infection rate in the world. Parents die of AIDS, just when their children need them most. An extended family can be their new home. Fortunately there is enough food in this farming district. But who will pay their school fees, provide medical aid and help them grow up? That is where ICCF Holland helps in the hope that they will be able to take care of themselves, and their children, in the long run.

Details on ICCF can be found in Vim by running `:help iccf`.

You can [sponsor Vim development](http://www.vim.org/sponsor/faq.php) by making a monetary donation and becoming a Vim registered user; you get to vote on what new features will be added to Vim!
